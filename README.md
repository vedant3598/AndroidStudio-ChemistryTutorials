# AndroidStudio-ChemistryTutorials
This application was created to help students with the prepare for their grade 12 Chemistry exam, according to Ontario's Chemistry 
curriculum so they can do well in the course and succeed. I have developed a wide variety of questions from all five topics that 
are in the Ontario grade 12 Chemistry curriculum with a timer so students can be tested in the manner of an exam. My goal was to develop an
Android application that can help students prepare for their exam in a fun way so they are more inclined to do well. I hope this helps 
all students in grade 12! Good luck!
